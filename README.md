# DragonGlide
An Android side-scrolling game with level progression and multiple game modes

Alternative keyboard controls: Q to move up, A to move down, S to shoot.
You can generate 100 gems by tapping on the nose of the dragon in the background of the main menu.
Generating 10000 gems this way functions as a "reset button", resetting your unlocked content.
